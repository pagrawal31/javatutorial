<b><font color="#00796B">Pros :</font></b><br>

1. Java is Simple<br>
2. Java is object-oriented because programming in Java is centered on creating objects, manipulating objects, and making objects work together. 
This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.<br>
3. One of the most significant advantages of Java is Platform indenpendence.<br>
4. Java is Secure: Java is one of the first programming languages to consider security as part of its design. <br>
5. Java is Multithreaded: Multithreaded is the capability for a program to perform several tasks simultaneously within a program.<br>
6. Java is Robust: Robust means reliable and no programming language can really assure reliability.<br><br>

<b><font color="#00796B">Cons:</font></b><br>
1. Java can be perceived as significantly slower and more memory-consuming than natively compiled languages such as C or C++.<br>
2. No local constants. In Java, variables that belong to a class can be made constant by declaring them to be final. Variables that are local to a method cannot be declared final, however.<br>
3. Java is predominantly a single-paradigm language. However, with the addition of static imports in Java 5.0 the procedural paradigm is better accommodated than in earlier versions of Java.
