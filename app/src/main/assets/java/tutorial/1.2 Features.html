<b><font color="#9400D3">1. Simple</font></b><br>
Java is easy to learn and its syntax is quite simple and easy to understand.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">2. Object-Oriented</font></b><br>
In java everything is Object which has some data and behaviour. Java can be easily extended as it is based on Object Model.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">3. Platform independent</font></b><br>
Unlike other programming languages such as C, C++ etc which are compiled into platform specific machines. Java is guaranteed to be write-once, run-anywhere language.<br><br>

On compilation Java program is compiled into bytecode. This bytecode is platform independent and can be run on any machine, plus this bytecode format also provide security.
Any machine with Java Runtime Environment can run Java Programs.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">4. Secured</font></b><br>
When it comes to security, Java is always the first choice. With java secure features it enable us to develop virus free, temper free system.
Java program always runs in Java runtime environment with almost null interaction with system OS, hence it is more secure.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">5. Robust</font></b><br>
Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone codes by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
But the main areas which Java improved were Memory Management and mishandled Exceptions by introducing automatic Garbage Collector and Exception Handling.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">6. Architecture neutral</font></b><br>
Compiler generates bytecodes, which have nothing to do with a particular computer architecture, hence a Java program is easy to intrepret on any machine.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">7. Portable</font></b><br>
Java Bytecode can be carried to any platform. No implementation dependent features. Everything related to storage is predefined, example: size of primitive data types <br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">8. High Performance</font></b><br>
Java is an interpreted language, so it will never be as fast as a compiled language like C or C++. But, Java enables high performance with the use of just-in-time compiler.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">9. Multithreaded</font></b><br>
Java multithreading feature makes it possible to write program that can do many tasks simultaneously.
Benefit of multithreading is that it utilizes same memory and other resources to execute multiple threads at the same time, like While typing, grammatical errors are checked along.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">10. Distributed</font></b><br>
We can create distributed applications in java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. We may access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.<br><br>

<b><font color="#9400D3">11. Interpreted</font></b><br>
An interpreter is needed in order to run Java programs. The programs are compiled into Java Virtual Machine code called bytecode. The bytecode is machine independent and is able to run on any machine that has a Java interpreter. With Java, the program need only be compiled once, and the bytecode generated by the Java compiler can run on any platform.
